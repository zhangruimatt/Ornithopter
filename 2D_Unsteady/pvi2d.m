% Panel Velocity Influence: returns the velocity induced by unit-strength
% source and vortex panels at a collection of points
% Used for constructing influence matrix


% Input:    panel = panel object
%           x = vector of x coordinates at which to evaluate induced velocity
%           y = vector of y coordinates at which to evaluate induced velocity
%
% Output:   [u,v] = velocity due to unit source distribution along panel
%           [U,V] = velocity due to unit vortex distribution along panel
%
% Note:     (U,V) is related to (u,v) by: U = -v, V = u
%
